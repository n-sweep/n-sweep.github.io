I played *Magic* for a long time, so this article really caught my eye. It's
behind a paywall, though, so if you don't have CNBC Pro, check out this second
article at *Magic*-specific publication Star City Games:

- #### [Hasbro Shares Plunge After Bank Of America Report Downgrades Company’s Rating](https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/hasbro-shares-plunge-after-bank-of-america-report-downgrades-companys-rating/)

This story made me think over what I remembered about collecting and playing
*Magic* in the 90s and 00s, and while doing some research to make sure I was
actually remembering things correctly, I wrote down a lot more than I expected.

### Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast, & Magic: the Gathering

Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in September of 1999. A [CNN Money
article](https://money.cnn.com/1999/09/09/deals/hasbro/) on the deal told
readers "The agreement gives Hasbro, one of the biggest producers of toys and
games, exclusive domain over Wizards' best-known products ...", explicitly
calling out "the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game" (of course) and
"particularly its Pokemon trading card game -- a wildly popular game among
children". No mention of lesser-known "Magic: the Gathering" (which wasn't
based on a popular tv show, hmm..)<sup>[1]</sup>, but that's no surprise
because it's the turn of the millennium and Pokemon is positively exploding.
Fast forward to October, 2022: Magic: the Gathering is [Hasbro's first
**BILLION** dollar
brand](https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/magic-the-gathering-becomes-hasbros-first-1-billion-brand/).
In the face of the Pokemon behemoth of the late 90s, who could have said it
would be Magic to break that ribbon? Well, some people at Hasbro, probably. But
someone else too: me. Not because I knew (or know) anything, but because I
loved (love) that damn game.

It's September of 99, Magic is 6, Pokemon is nearly 3, and I am 11. And despite
being smack in the bull's eye of Pokemon's target demographic, I'm already an
avid Magic player, thanks in no small part to my older cousin who found and
played the game long before I was old enough to (I have fond memories of
looking at the wonderful artwork on his cards years before rediscovering the
game in middle school). Hasbro made the purchase and I was too young to really
*get it*, but some of the older guys at the local card shop where I sourced my
habit lamented the end of an era. I *got it* a few years later, when they
decided to [update the style of the
frame](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Eighth_Edition#Card_frame), or border
surrounding the text and artwork of the card. I *got it* again years later when
["double-faced" cards](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Double-faced_card) were
introduced, which could transform (or flip) to a different card printed on the
back. This one was an atrocity, the back of a Magic card is beautiful and
sacred.<sup>[2]</sup> At this point I had been playing competitively for more
than a decade, and not long after made the decision to spend my time and money
on music instead of Magic (those cards had appreciated a bit and sure bought a
lot of recording equipment).

But let's be real, all that stuff is pretty much superficial. Fans care about
it, I cared about it, but the brand didn't only
[survive](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeparlock/2021/02/09/magic-the-gathering-had-its-best-financial-year-ever-in-2020/?sh=33db86381f0a),
it [thrived](https://www.thegamer.com/2021-magic-the-gathering-best-year/).
Certainly none of these things were the "end-of-an-era" of a caliber that
warranted CNBC articles about the BoA downgrading the company's rating. Right?
Maybe:

- Hasbro buys WotC in 1999, to the lament of some Magic players
- Hasbro changes Magic cards in 2003, much to the lament of many more Magic
  players
- !!! from
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game):
  "In June 2003, Nintendo transferred the publishing rights from Wizards of the
  Coast to The Pokémon Company"
- Hasbro changes magic cards again in 2004, very much to the further lament of
  even more Magic players

Nintendo bailed when things were chaotic, perhaps it was a sign of the
beginning of a slow decline? Well, we'd have to ignore the fact the Magic
continued to be wildly successful for 16 more years before the next
cherry-picked part of my story, but perhaps.

Despite being years away from the game, I *got it* once again in 2020 when WotC
announced a "The Walking Dead" crossover set, the first in what would
eventually become the ["Universes
Beyond"](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Universes_Beyond) sub-brand of Magic,
whatever a "sub-brand" is. The game still holds a place in my heart and this
decision made me feel some feelings, but I didn't play any more so I tried not
to have too many opinions. And there was also a pandemic going on I think.
Anyway, WotC went on to release 10 more Universes Beyond sets between then and
today, with four more on the way; these include such theme-conforming
properties as Fortnite, Transformers, and Dr. Who. Grim, indeed.

So was the Walking Dead crossover set the real beginning of the end for
Hasbro's golden boy? If we define "end" to mean a CNBC article about the BoA
downgrading the company's rating, then yes, I think so.

But even given all the uncertainty around the future of Magic, we can all be
sure of one thing: I sure miss playing that stupid game. And that stupid game
is worth a billion dollars lol. That's two things.

<sup>[1]</sup> An astute reader has pointed out that, while not based on a tv
show, Magic tournaments were indeed featured on
[ESPN2](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/ESPN) - there is even [footage on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQuXalg4PKs) (warning: kind of loud).

<sup>[2]</sup> This is an opinion, but not really.
