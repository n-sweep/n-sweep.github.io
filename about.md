I'm a data scientist, python developer, and recent graduate of [Galvanize Inc](https://www.linkedin.com/school/galvanize-it)'s Data Science Immersive program. I'm also a musician, 3d printing & cnc enthusiast, and raspberry pi lover. I don't particularly care for writing but I keep hearing it's an important skill, so here we are.

My intention for this blog is to be at once a journal of reminders to my future self and an exercise in writing about the code that I write. Hopefully (/theoretically/allegedly) this exercise will lead to a better understanding of the code, the problems it hopes to solve, and perhaps even my own self. Pretty zen.

If you've found yourself here, thank you for reading. I hope you found something useful today.
