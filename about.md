I am a musician, raspberry pi lover, 3d printing & cnc enthusiast, and reformed
Magic: the Gathering player. I'm also a lead data scientist at
[ClosedLoop.ai](https://closedloop.ai). I don't particularly care for writing
but I keep hearing it's an important skill, so here we are.

My intention for this blog is to be at once a journal of reminders to my future
self and an exercise in writing about the code that I write. Hopefully
(/theoretically/allegedly) this exercise will lead to a better understanding of
the code, the problems the code hopes to solve, and perhaps even my own self.
Pretty zen.
