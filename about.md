I am a musician, raspberry pi lover, 3d printing & cnc enthusiast, and reformed
Magic: the Gathering player. I'm also a lead data scientist at
[ClosedLoop.ai](https://closedloop.ai). I don't particularly care for writing
but I keep hearing it's an important skill, so here we are.

This is a blog about tech, music, and whatever else I might find myself
inspired enough to write about.
