## Done for Real!

Finally, head back over to **https://_username_.github.io**, and smash your F5 key as the blood, sweat and tears of the giants upon whose shoulders we stand push your bits through the tubes and out into vastness of the internet *for the mother brain to consume. Refresh and do not turn away, for soon the Old Ones will return and they will reach up, grasping, and take us back to that great vastness, that endless sea. Protesting? Not us, for we go willingly, and* would you look at that! Your opinion on the internet! Out*standing!*
