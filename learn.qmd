# Testimonials

> Working with Noah was like attending a masterclass on advanced Python during our time as data science residents. What I truly admire about him is his uncanny ability to expedite my learning process. While there's a plethora of topics I aim to grasp, time is often limited. Whenever I get stuck or spend excessive time on a data engineering or computer science issue, I know it's Noah-time for a swift solution session. I can't recommend Noah enough for anyone navigating Python, particularly the intricate challenges. He will save you time and eliminate frustrations. [...]
