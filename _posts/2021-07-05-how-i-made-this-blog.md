Recently I learned how to use a `Dockerfile` to build custom Docker images. After building an image based on Alpine Linux to run neovim and zsh for a consistent and portable text editor and python environment (I'll write about that soon), I wanted to document the process for my future self. Coincidentally, I had also recently read how easy it was to host a website with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and I just needed an excuse to learn how. It's all coming together.

# Hosting with Github Pages

> Note: I completed these steps on a `Pop!_OS 21.04` machine.

## First, Some Prerequisites
We will need Git and Docker installed. Later, we're going to use Docker to pull down a Jekyll image so we don't have to install Jekyll and all its dependencies. If you have trouble with these commands, check these installation links for [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) & [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install).

``` bash
# Update
sudo apt-get update

# Install Git
sudo apt-get install git-all

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

## [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) A New GitHub Repository
If you don't know how, just visit the link above. Your repo should be named with your github username in the format `username.github.io` for GitHub to host it correctly.

## Clone the Repo and Add Some Content!
Next, move to the directory where you would like to store your site's files and clone the repo to your local machine. Navigate into the repo directory and create an index markdown file, which will serve as your site's home page, and finally push your changes back up to GitHub:

``` bash
# From pages.github.com

# Clone Repo
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git

# Navigate into project folder
cd username.github.io

# Create index.md
echo "C O N T E N T" > index.md

# Push changes
git add --all
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

<br />

## And You're finished!
Well done. Grab a cold beverage, pat yourself on the back, and visit **https://_username_.github.io** in a browser to view your handiwork.

### Looks Kinda Boring Though, Doesn't It?
Sure does. And I'm no good at this front end stuff so rather than pretend otherwise, we'll take GitHub's advice and use Jekyll, whatever that is.

# Adding Some Spice with a Jekyll Theme

From the GitHub [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll):

> Jekyll is a static site generator with built-in support for GitHub Pages and a simplified build process. Jekyll takes Markdown and HTML files and creates a complete static website based on your choice of layouts...

I'm not familiar with Jekyll in the slightest, but I am familiar with Docker, and a quick trip to Docker Hub yields an official [Jekyll Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll)! Now we can pull down the image and use Jekyll without installing it locally. Score.

## Pull Down the Docker Jekyll Image

If you try to call `docker run` on an image you don't have locally, Docker will attempt to retrieve the image from Docker Hub. We'll run the Jekyll version 3.8 image (I had a weird permissions problem with the latest build), pull it down from the hub, and open up a bash shell inside of it.

``` bash
# You're probably still there but if not, navigate to the repo directory
cd /path/to/username.github.io

# Pull down and open a shell in the Jekyll image
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 -v ${PWD}:/srv/jekyll jekyll/jekyll:3.8 bash
```

This may take a minute.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/docker_install.gif" />

While you wait for the Jekyll image to download, let's talk about what this command is doing. 

From the [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/):
> The `docker run` command first `creates` a writeable container layer over the specified image, and then `starts` it using the specified command.

- `docker run --rm -it`
    - create a container that will be removed (`--rm`) when we're finished with it and enble an interactive terminal connection (`-it`)*
- `-p 4000:4000`
    - publish (or expose) port 4000 on the local machine to the same port inside the container (this is the port Jekyll uses to serve locally)
    - these ports do not have to match, eg. `-p 9999:80` could be a valid mapping
    - local port is always first: `local_port:container_port`
- `-v ${PWD}:/srv/jekyll`
    - mount the directory we're currently in (`${PWD}`) to the directory that Jekyll uses to build the site inside the container (`/srv/jekyll`)
    - again, local is always first: `local_dir:container_dir`
- `jekyll/jekyll:3.8 bash`
    - specify that we want the official `jekyll/jekyll` image version `3.8`
    - start the container and open an interactive `bash` shell

You can find more information about the `docker run` flags in the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)  
\* You can find a great explaination of the `-i` & `-t` flags at this StackOverflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40026942/11737314)

> ### **Important Note!**
> In a moment, we will use Jekyll to build the structure and theme for our site.  
> By mapping our site's local git repository to `/srv/jekyll` in the container, we allow Jekyll to save all the site files it generates locally in our repo. *These files are all GitHub needs to build our site* at **https://_username_.github.io**.  
> This allows us to ditch our Docker container (and even the image) when we're finished, freeing up the space taken up by Jekyll and its dependencies and leaving behind the site files for us to push to GitHub for hosting.

## Build Your Jekyll Site and Check Out the New Template!

A nice feature of Jekyll is that it can serve your site locally, so you can check that you're happy with your edits before pushing them up to your repo. So now that we're in the shell inside our container, we'll use Jekyll to create a new site, then serve it and take a look in the browser.

``` bash
# Instantiate new site
jekyll new .

# Serve the site locally
jekyll serve
```

This may take some time as well.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/jekyll_new_serve.gif" />

Great! Now we can visit **http://localhost:4000** and see that we have the basic Jekyll theme applied to our page on our own machine before pushing the repo back to GitHub. Neat! ðŸ“·

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/jekyll_basic.jpg" />

todo: editing fields

It's better but you've gotta admit, the default theme is still pretty boring. So now it's time to choose your own!

## Find A Theme!

There are a lot to choose from, and the Jekyll documenatation has a [good list](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) of resources for themes. I ended up at [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/) and found [Monophase](https://zivlog.io/monophase/). Not much more exciting than the Jekyll default we just saw, but I was going for minimal.  

Maybe [Neumorphism](https://longpdo.github.io/neumorphism/) is more your style?  

Or [Windows 95](https://h01000110.github.io/windows-95/)?

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/windows95.jpg" />

### Installation

> Note: It probably goes without saying, but always be aware of the licensing associated with others' code you plan to download and use. Most free Jekyll themes only require attribution and already have it built into the footer of the theme.

> It also absolutely goes without saying, but remember McGruff the Crime Dog says "always be mindful of any code you download from anywhere". This is (obviously) not a security blog!

If you navigate to their GitHub repos, many of the themes at the links above have their own instructions for installation but for themes that don't, it's as easy as [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and pulling the repo and teaking as needed.

``` bash
# First, fork the repo (see the link above)
# Then clone locally
git clone https://github.com/username/windows-95
```
Themes will have pages such as `index`, `about`, `archive`, etc... that can be edited to your liking.

We'll leave further tweaking of style and layout as an exercise to the reader (because, to be honest, it's an exercise for me also). Your theme of choice's GitHub is usually a good place to start. There's also [google](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=customize+jekyll+theme).

# Make A Post!

The time has come. This is what you've been training for. Unless of course you've chosen a different theme layout such as a landing page, CV, or gallery and this section is irrelevant to you.

Anyway, after completing the previous steps we should have a `_posts/` directory in our repo and, as luck would have it, we're gonna keep our posts in there. Even if you haven't downloaded a custom theme, the standard Jekyll theme created when we called `jekyll new .` should include a sample post in this directory. The sample includes includes instructions on creating your own posts. Make a copy and use it as a template!

Once you've finished your new post, push it back up to GitHub. This should look familiar from way back when we hosted our very first C O N T E N T:

> Note: as your repo gets more complex, you don't always want to `git add --all`. Read [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) about `.gitignore` or `git add` files individually.

``` bash
# Push changes
git add --all   # See note above
git commit -m "publishing a post!"
git push -u origin main
```

## Done for Real!

Finally, head back over to **https://_username_.github.io**, and[ ](https://n-sweep.github.io/alts/how-i-made-this-blog/#done-for-real)would you look at that! Your opinion on the internet! Out*standing!*
